This is a internship task Task1 is to do list application.
This C++ console-based to-do list application welcomes users and 
offers a menu-driven interface for task management. Users can press 'M' or 'm' to display the menu, which allows them to add tasks (performing addition, subtraction, or multiplication on two numbers), 
mark tasks as done, and view the current task. 
The application uses a do-while loop to ensure the menu is displayed at least once and continues to loop as long as the user inputs 'M' or 'm'. 
Various user inputs are handled using a switch statement and nested conditionals to execute the appropriate operations based on user choices.

This is task 2 encryption anbd decryption of text 
his C++ program provides a simple encryption and decryption functionality for a string of up to 25 characters. 
The main function prompts the user to input a string and then choose whether to encrypt or decrypt it by entering 1 or 2, respectively. 
The encrypt and decrypt functions each request a key from the user and adjust each character of the string by adding or subtracting this key's value. 
The program uses a while loop to allow continuous operations until the user decides to exit by entering any character other than 'y' when prompted. 
This interactive approach makes it straightforward for users to repeatedly encrypt or decrypt strings within a single execution.
